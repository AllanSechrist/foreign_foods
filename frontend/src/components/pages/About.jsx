            <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Allan, although if you are reading this its likely that you already knew that. 
              I don't expect anyone outside of family and friends to actually ever see this, but hey, you never know right?
              I have lived in Japan since 2018, originally coming from California. My origial plan was to spend the first year
              exploring what Tokyo had to offer and then try as much as possible to see much more of Japan. Current on going
              global complications have...complicated that, but said complications have affected everyone, so I can't really complain.

              I started this website mainly as a project to put my Flask skills to some use. The idea for it to be a collection of restaurants
              sort of happend randomly. After finishing the first ideration of this project, my friend Juan convinced me to actually get it running 
              online.
